## Purpose of Project
Our project is an online marketplace for people living in housing communities specifically on college campuses to sell each other household items. Our project was inspired by how often we find ourselves missing just one small ingredient, or simple item, that could save us a trip to the grocery store and money if we could just borrow a little bit from our neighbors. 

Our app allows users to either request or loan items to their neighbors. When requesting an item, users can put the price they are willing to pay for it. Then, people who live in the same community as them can go through a feed of what people near them need, and if they have it, sell it to their neighbors. When someone agrees to loan the item, the person requesting can see where in their building to go to get it, and have the item from the comfort of their building. 

## Tools Utilized

We utilized React for this project, with a Flask backend. We used a Sqlite database for housing our data. 

## Problems Encountered and Solutions

The problems we encountered were mainly with react libraries. We had some issues with installations, but were able to resolve them with online resources.

## Next Steps

We began working on using Capital One's Nessie API to keep track of both customers and merchants. We wanted to be able to display past transactions within the app, and use the API to do this.

We also plan on adding an inventory section, where users can upload common items they have in advance, so they can be notified if someone is looking for those and upload them to the app.
